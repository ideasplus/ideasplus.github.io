# 📖 Biography

I am a PhD candidate in the Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, supervised by Prof. Yu Wen.

My research interests lie at the intersection of security, autonomous driving, and machine learning. 

My current focus is on exploring the vulnerabilities of AI-powered autonomous driving systems to deliberate attackers and developing effective defense strategies to enhance the safety of autonomous driving in adversarial environments.
